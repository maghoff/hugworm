Targetting WASM
===============
Inspect or run `prepare-wasm.sh` to get build dependencies.

Run `build-wasm.sh` to build.

To run in a browser, you can use `basic-http-server`:

    # Install:
    cargo install basic-http-server

    # Start:
    basic-http-server site

The program is now available at <http://127.0.0.1:4000/>.
